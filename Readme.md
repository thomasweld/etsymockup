Re-Create an Etsy Search Page - https://www.etsy.com/search?q=whiskey

Utilize the data for whatever search term you use - DATA HERE
You are free to change the search term to whatever you'd like.
We haven't covered how to fetch data using JavaScript, so just copy the data and store it in a variable and separate file.
Everything should be styled as closely as possible, including the Header/Sidebar/Links/Search (you can ignore the footer, dropdowns & refine your search area)
You should implement hover events and link the items to their proper Etsy product pages (items only, other links can be just linked to #)
No need to make any of the form elements work, just style them properly
You can ignore the "Top categories for ..." section as that is not in the data.
Pro Tip, worry about the structure first, the JS second and the fine details of the design last
Note: (heart, cart and hamburger icons) are in an assets folder below.
