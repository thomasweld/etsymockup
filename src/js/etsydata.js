"policy_welcome": "Hello and welcome to our shop! My name is Amy, and my husband, Tyler and I are the owners and creators of Liquid Courage. We have been selling online since 2003. Recently, we decided to make the leap from selling items made by others to selling items that we make. We have been goofing around making all sorts of arts, crafts, scrapbooks, and clothing for many years and decided to combine my hobby with my online business experience. \r\n\r\nTyler has an Accounting degree from Tennessee Technological University, and I have a bachelor&#39;s degree in Marketing and an MBA in Accounting from TTU as well.  Upon graduating, we tried &quot;real, grown-up jobs&quot; - Tyler as a general manager at a greenhouse manufacturing company, and I as a staff accountant for a nationwide manufacturing company.  We spent a couple of years working for &quot;the man&quot;...at a desk eight hours a day...fifty weeks a year.\r\n\r\nWe finally decided to follow our dream of becoming entrepreneurs, pursue our passion, and determine our own future with hands on approach. We chose the path less traveled by, and that has made all the difference.\r\n\r\nPlease don&#39;t hesitate to ask if you have any questions or would like a custom item.\r\n\r\n(888) 959-2870 (M-F 9am - 5pm Eastern)\r\nor\r\nConvo us anytime! \r\n\r\nCheers! \r\nTyler and Amy",

Meriwether designs and sells unique, one of kind gifts for people of all ages (but it helps if you are young at heart.) We have an immense appreciation for well crafted objects and we are drawn toward the nostalgic and the whimsical. Deep down we possess a deep yearning for the Good Ol&#39; Days and desperately wish we could go back...\r\n\r\nMeriwether offers a wonderfully eclectic array of beer gifts, wine gifts and gifts both odd and unique. We require that everything we sell be functional and beautiful (and if it makes you giggle just a bit that works too.) But our primary goal is to make the gift giver a hero -because we know that it feels so amazing when you get to give that perfect gift....\r\n\r\nIf you are in Whitefish, Montana we have a full retail gift boutique right in downtown Whitefish. Our retail store is a peachy (yes... peachy) place to shop for gifts and goodies of all kinds - especially for gifts for dads, gifts for beer lovers, gifts for wine lovers, gifts for coffee lovers... and gifts for people who love to laugh and love to own quality goods. (you get the point...)\r\n\r\nAs a special bonus, many of the gift items we sell can be engraved. Giving an engraved gift is a super way to add that personal touch to your gift. Be sure to read about our personalized gift and engraved gift options.\r\n\r\nAnd what about the name Meriwether? Our name is inspired by Meriwether Lewis... of Lewis and Clark fame. Dan is a huge aficionado of the Lewis and Clark expedition and the Corp of Discovery passed through our neck of the woods on their way to the Pacific coast.",

If getting &quot;exact&quot; is critical, please let us know at order so we can find the previous order documents and make sure we use the same machinist to engrave the order. We may request a visual photo of the sample for a final reference.   \r\n",
